  "careerSummary": "A full of enthusiasm, and an innovative backend engineer with a passion to tackle knotted problems. During my five-month tenure as a full-stack developer (.NET) at the Middle East Automobile & Tourism Club (M.A.C), I spearheaded the development of various applications, enhancing the existing codebase, and building systems that expanded their service offerings as well as customer satisfaction. Having a robust grounding in core software engineering principles and guidelines, including SOLID Principles, architectural patterns, design patterns, object-oriented design, data structures, algorithms, and various architectures, with a fully understanding of various models of software production like SDLC and incremental and iterative incremental-based models, it facilitates rapid adaptation to new technologies no matter the syntax. Eager to join and contribute to projects that will create a positive and sustainable impact on the community.",
